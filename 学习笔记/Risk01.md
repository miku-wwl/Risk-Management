# 2. The Engineering Risk Management (ERM) process



![image-20210312135052049](C:\Users\君上\Desktop\Risk.assets\image-20210312135052049.png)

~~~
ERM can handle many types of risks, including:

accident risks
natural disasters
fire risks
technical risks
social risks
labour risks.
~~~

~~~

Risk management creates and protects value. Risk management contributes to the demonstrable achievement of objectives and improvement of performance, including:

human health and safety,
security, legal and regulatory compliance,
public acceptance, environmental protection, and product quality,
project management, efficiency in operations, governance and reputation.
~~~



~~~
Risk management is based on the best available information. Information sources can include:

historical data
experience
stakeholder feedback
observation
forecasts
expert judgement.

Risk treatment is a cyclical process
Risk treatment is a cyclical process that consists of two key steps. These are assessing risk treatment and assessing the effectiveness of that risk treatment. Assessment of the risk treatment is a process which consists of determining the tolerability of residual risk levels. If the risk level is not tolerable than a new treatment will need to be implemented. Following on from assessing the risk treatment, is the process of assessing the effectiveness of the risk treatment.

Risk treatment options are not necessarily mutually exclusive or appropriate in all circumstances. The options can include the following:

Avoiding the risk by deciding not to start or continue with the activity that gives rise to the risk;
Taking or increasing the risk in order to pursue an opportunity;
Removing the risk source;
Changing the likelihood;
Changing the consequences;
Sharing the risk with another party or parties (including contracts and risk financing);
Retaining the risk by informed decision.

# 5. Management Systems

~~~
There are two broad categories of management systems:
1. Business Management Systems
2. Risk Management Systems
~~~

# 6. Business Management Systems 

~~~
Business Management Systems
➢ Business management systems are concerned with developing, deploying and executing
business strategies.
➢ Business management systems specifically aim at improving the quality or business
performance of an organization, through the optimization of stakeholder satisfaction, with a
focus on clients such as ISO Standard 9001:2008 or extended to other stakeholders (e.g.
employees, society, shareholders, etc.) such as the EFQM 2010 Model for Business
Excellence or the ISO 9004:2009 Guidelines
~~~

# 7. Risk Management Systems

~~~
➢ Risk management systems focus on reducing risks of safety, health, environmental, security
and ethical.
➢ Some of the most popular generic examples of risk management systems are:
▪ International standard for environmental management ISO 14001:2004.
▪ European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme EMAS.
▪ International standard for occupational safety and health OHSAS 18001:2007.
▪ International standard for integrity management SA 8000.
▪ ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems Requirements
~~~

# 8. Integrated Management Systems

~~~
➢ The boundaries of those two management systems are to fade in recent years. Therefore,
integrated risk management models have emerged:
▪ Recognizing the positive as well as the negative possible outcomes of risks.
▪ Considering all kinds of risks: operational, financial, strategic, juridical, etc.
▪ Surpassing compliance and continuous improvement.
▪ Canadian Integrated Risk Management Framework (2001)
▪ Australian-New Zealand standard AS/NZS 4360:2004, which served as the basis for the
development of the generic ISO Risk Management Standard 31000:2009.
~~~

# 9. Managing Risks and Uncertainties

![image-20210312141509852](C:\Users\君上\Desktop\Risk.assets\image-20210312141509852.png)



~~~
Organizations should manage risks in a way that the negative outcomes are minimized
and that the positive outcomes are maximized, this is called risk management.
~~~

~~~
➢ In current industrial practice, risk management is only focused on negative risks, and only
on avoiding losses, instead of simultaneously avoiding losses and producing gains.
➢ Risk managers have been appointed in organizations mainly to satisfy legislative
requirements or because of incidents and accidents that happened within firms; hence the
only risks that needed to be managed displayed possible negative consequences.
➢ Risks should be viewed from a holistic viewpoint, meaning that all relevant stakeholders
and experts should be involved in the risk management process.
➢ The end goal is to use all the right people and means, at the right time, to manage all
existing risks in the best possible way, whether the risks are positive or negative, or whether
they are known or not.
~~~

# 10. Mathematics and Risk Management Analogy

![image-20210312142228810](C:\Users\君上\Desktop\Risk.assets\image-20210312142228810.png)

~~~
➢ Risk management can actually be compared
with mathematics.
➢ Both disciplines are commonly regarded as
“auxiliary science” domains, helping other “true
sciences” to get everything right.
➢ Mathematics is needed for correct laws in
physics, chemistry, etc., and risk management is
required for optimized applications in physics,
chemistry.
~~~

# 11. Risks and Uncertainties Complexity

![image-20210312142538431](C:\Users\君上\Desktop\Risk.assets\image-20210312142538431.png)

~~~
➢ Risk means different things to different people
at different times.
➢ As mentioned, one element characterizing risk
is the notion of uncertainty.
➢ This figure displays the uncertainty sandglass,
with SWOT elements situated within the
concept.
~~~

# 12. The Focus of 49006

~~~
The focus is on upper triangle, hazards, exposure
to hazards, and losses.
▪ If one of these elements is removed from this
triangle, there is no risk.
▪ The engineering aspects of risk management in
this subject focus on how to diminish, decrease or
soften as much as possible one of the three
elements or a combination thereof.
~~~

# 13. Risks and Uncertainties Complexity

~~~
There are three types of uncertainties can be identified:
▪ Type I uncertainties where a lot of historical data is available (from negative risk
viewpoint, affect individual employees, e.g. work-related accidents).
▪ Type II uncertainties where little or very little historical data is available (affect a company,
e.g. large explosions, internal domino effects).
▪ Type III uncertainties where no historical data is available (unprecedented and unseen
disasters, e.g. Seveso (Italy, 1976), Bhopal (India, 1984), 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (USA,
2001), Fukushima (Japan, 2011))
~~~

# 14. Hazards and Risks 

~~~
➢ Hazard is defined as “The potential of a human, machine, equipment, process, material, or
physical factor to lead to an unwanted event possibly causing harm to people, environment,
assets or production”.
➢ (Negative) Risk is the possibility of loss (fatality, injury, damage, detriment, etc.) created by
exposure to one or more hazards, and can be calculated as

# 16. Physical Description of Risk

~~~
A threat is the potential of a hazard to cause
damage.
➢ Risk is physically characterized by four elements:
• A hazard.
• One or many targets threatened by the hazard.
• The evaluation of the threat.
• The measures taken to reduce the threat.

# 17. Simplified Interpretation of Risk

~~~
Risk cannot be felt by human senses; it can be only measured or estimated.
➢ The simplest model defines that the probability of a certain risk depends on:
▪ The frequency by which the target is exposed to the hazard (sometimes called likelihood of
occurrence), supposing that the hazard threatens the target.
▪ The evaluation of its consequence corresponding to a measurement of the severity of the mentioned
consequences.

Risk = frequency × severity
R = F · G
~~~

# 18. Risk Calculation

![image-20210312143957267](C:\Users\君上\Desktop\Risk.assets\image-20210312143957267.png)

~~~
➢ Such an equation of risk is very convenient for many purposes, but it also creates several
difficulties:
▪ Determining the units in which risk is measured: Risk can be expressed in terms of number of
fatalities, the monetary losses per unit of time, the probability of certain injuries to people, the
probability of a certain level of damage to the environment, etc.
▪ In some cases, especially in Type II and III events, it is obviously very difficult to estimate the
likelihood of a given unwanted event and the magnitude of its consequences.
~~~

# 19. Simplified Interpretation of Risk

![image-20210312144512837](C:\Users\君上\Desktop\Risk.assets\image-20210312144512837.png)

~~~
➢ Changing the risk by reducing the occurrence of its components and/or their severity
means addressing the following questions:
– Is it possible to reduce the number of exposed targets (N)?
– Is it possible to reduce the time the targets are exposed to the hazard (T)?
– Is it possible to increase the prevention measurements (Pre)?
– Is it possible to reduce the hazardousness (D)?
– Is it possible to increase the level of protection (Pro)?

# 20. ERM – AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009

![image-20210312144809790](C:\Users\君上\Desktop\Risk.assets\image-20210312144809790.png)

~~~
➢ For risk management to be effective, an organization should at all levels comply with the
principles of AS/NZS ISO 31000:
❖ RM creates and protects value.
❖ RM is an integral part of all organizational processes (not a stand-alone activity).
❖ RM is part of decision-making.
❖ RM explicitly addresses uncertainty.
❖ RM is systematic, structured and timely.
❖ RM is based on the best available information
~~~

~~~
➢ AS/NZS ISO 31000 principles (continued):
❖ RM is tailored and is aligned with the organization’s external and internal context and risk
profile.
❖ RM takes human and cultural factors into account.
❖ RM is transparent and inclusive.
❖ RM is dynamic, iterative and responsive to change (RM continually senses and responds
to change).
❖ RM facilitates continual improvement of the organization
~~~

# 21. Objectives and Importance of ERM 

~~~
"the early and continuous identification, assessment,
and resolution of non-financial risks such that the most effective and efficient decisions can
be taken to manage these risks"
~~~

~~~
ERM offers an answer to the ever more difficult task of managing the risks of organizational
systems, technology, infrastructure, etc.
➢ Early and continuous risk identification, risk-informed (risk-based) decision-making, gaining
a systemic overview of an organization, proactive planning for unwanted events, proactive
learning and learning from incidents, intelligent resource allocation, situational awareness
and risk trends, etc.
~~~

~~~
Well-known management disciplines of ERM:
❖ Operation management (ERM of operations)
❖ Change management (ERM of changes)
❖ Project management (ERM of projects)
❖ Crisis management (ERM of crises)
❖ Innovation management (ERM of innovations)
❖ etc
~~~

# 22. Summary

~~~
➢The only certain thing about future is that everything is uncertain.
➢ Risks need three factors: hazards, losses and exposure.
➢ Decreasing (or even avoiding or taking away) one of these
parameters, or (one of) the characteristics of these parameters,
in one way or another, leads to lower risks (or even to no risk).
➢ AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 provides the risk management
process, principles, and values
